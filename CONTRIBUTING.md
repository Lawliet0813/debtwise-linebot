## Commit message style

We follow a light version of the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format. Use the structure below:

```
<type>(optional scope): <short summary>

[optional body]
[optional footer(s)]
```

### Allowed commit types

* `feat` – user-facing features or improvements
* `fix` – bug fixes
* `docs` – documentation changes
* `chore` – maintenance tasks, dependency bumps
* `refactor` – code refactors without behavior change
* `test` – adding or updating tests
* `build` – build system or tooling changes

### Best practices

* Use the imperative mood in summaries (e.g., `fix bug` instead of `fixed bug`).
* Keep the summary under 72 characters.
* Include a body when more context or testing notes are helpful.
* Reference issues with `Fixes #123` or `Refs #123` when applicable.

Happy hacking! If you have any questions, open an issue or reach out to the maintainers.
